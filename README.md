# A easy-to-remember password generator chrome add-in
This chrome add-in can be used to generate human readable passwords. Like a lot of people I was using a few common passwords on a lot of sites which is a really bad security practice. I needed passwords which I could 

I created the add-in after The issue it tries to solve is that the random password generators online produce passwords that can never be memorized or communicated. All popular password managers like LastPass, 1Password, Dashlane have password generators but generate unreadable passwords

 1. [LastPass generator](https://www.lastpass.com/password-generator)
	 - Example: 
		 - #P@8Mh8PU9*t
		 - *oP6RWYmaVif  	
 2. [1Password generator](https://1password.com/password-generator/)
	 - Example:
		 - P52QvT5rpWo
		 - adroit-solvency-heaven 
		 - lithium-almost-whom
 3. [Dashlane generator](https://www.dashlane.com/features/password-generator)
	 - Example:
		 - ~6R"N#M'FFt 
		 - *xf8mbrXp$.
		 - *yMn'!d"h8E

1Password comes closest with its "Memorable Password" but the password is too long. Sure the passwords are secure but I think we can do better.
