# A easy-to-remember password generator chrome add-in

<div style="text-align:center"><img width="400" src="images/readme_image1.png?raw=true"/></div>

This chrome add-in can be used to generate human readable passwords. Like a lot of people I was using the same couple of passwords on a lot of sites which is a really bad security practice. I needed passwords which are all different but which I could also remember if needed.

All popular password managers like LastPass, 1Password, Dashlane, Roboform have password generators but generate unreadable passwords

 1. [LastPass generator](https://www.lastpass.com/password-generator)
	 - Example: 
		 - #P@8Mh8PU9*t
		 - *oP6RWYmaVif  	
 2. [1Password generator](https://1password.com/password-generator/)
	 - Example:
		 - P52QvT5rpWo
		 - adroit-solvency-heaven 
		 - lithium-almost-whom
 3. [Dashlane generator](https://www.dashlane.com/features/password-generator)
	 - Example:
		 - ~6R"N#M'FFt 
		 - *xf8mbrXp$.
		 - *yMn'!d"h8E

1Password comes closest with its "Memorable Password" but the passwords are too long. Sure the passwords are secure but I think this add-in generates better passwords. 

Some sample passwords generated by this add-on
 - SteepHeavy80@
 - WhitePrior54
 - ShallowAmazing6
