# Nice password generator
This chrome add-in can be used to generate human readable passwords. The issue it tries to solve is that the random password generators online produce passwords that can never be memorized or communicated. All popular password managers like LastPass, 1Password, Dashlane have password generators but generate unreadable passwords

 1. [LastPass generator](https://www.lastpass.com/password-generator)
	 - Example: 
		 - #P@8Mh8PU9*t
		 - *oP6RWYmaVif  	
 2. [1Password generator](https://1password.com/password-generator/)
	 - Example:
		 - adroit-solvency-heaven 
 3. [Dashlane generator](https://www.dashlane.com/features/password-generator)

1Password comes closest with its "Memorable Password" but the passwords are too long.
